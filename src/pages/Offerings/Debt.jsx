            Bonds are fixed-income securities that provide regular interest payments (coupon payments) 
            and return of principal at maturity. They offer a safer investment option compared to 
            stocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideal for conservative investors, bonds provide capital safety and predictable income, 
            making them a cornerstone of balanced investment portfolios.
